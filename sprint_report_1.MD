# Sprint 1 Report (1/6/2025 - 2/2/2025)

## What's New (User Facing)
 * Nothing new added yet.

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
The primary goal of this sprint is documentation completion and github repo initialization. The readme.MD, project description, client meeting hours, were added to the repo; the preceding team’s work was moved to the current repository from this link: https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-S24-F24/-mda-unity3dapp-. Our team is currently researching work on the metal whisker modeling project. Team cohesion needs to improve slightly. The liaison for this sprint could have done better in distributing the workload.
