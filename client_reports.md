# Client Meetings Report

<h2>Agenda (<em>1/28/2025</em>)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Initial client greeting.</li>
  <li>Brief explanation of tin whiskers.</li>
  <li>Brief explanation of preceding team's work.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Minutes</h2>
<p>NASA subject matter expert Mr. Jay Brusse, MDA STEM advisor Dr. Donna Havrisik, government sponsor at MDA Mr. Stephen Wells made initial contact with members of our team, Ram Logic. Additionally, Mr. Jay Brusse gave our team a brief overview of metal whiskers.
Mr. Jay Brusse asked to set up a second meeting to further inform our team of tin whiskers.</p>

<h2>Retrospective Summary</h2>
<h3>This went well:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Initial greetings were thorough, and our team was able to extract important information of client roles.</li>
  <li>Subject matter expert, Mr. Jay Brusse, gave a concise explanation on tin whiskers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>This needs improvement:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Understanding of project goals.</li>
  <li>Understanding of predecessor work.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes to implement ASAP:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Immediate changes are unneccesary; time should be spent researching predecessor work.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Agenda (<em>1/30/2025</em>)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Historical overview of metal whiskers.</li>
  <li>Cause of metal whisker growth.</li>
  <li>Discussion of important mathematical concepts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Minutes</h2>
<p>NASA subject matter expert Mr. Jay Brusse explains the impact of metal whiskers historically and attempts at preventing metal whisker growth. Mr. Jay Brusse discussed the growth of metal whiskers, emphasizing it is not conceptually similar to 
"squeezing a tube of toothpaste." Finally Mr. Brusse touches on important statistical concepts in this projects context such as the lognormal distribution.</p>

<h2>Retrospective Summary</h2>
<h3>This went well:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The importance of the project is emphasized as Mr. Brusse discussed the historical tin whisker failures.</li>
  <li>Lognormal distribution and the Monte Carlo Method were discussed and set as one of the team's learning goals.</li>
</ul>

<h3>This needs improvement:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Mr. Brusse emphasizes the importance of learning the preceding team's code base as well as challenges they faced.</li>
  <li>Understanding of project goals.</li>
  <li>Understanding of client requirements.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes to implement ASAP:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Brush up on statistical concepts.</li>
  <li>Dive into preceding team's work.</li>
</ul>
