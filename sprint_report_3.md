# Sprint 3 Report (3/2/2025 - 4/2/2025)

## What's New (User Facing)
 * Fixed UI hovering bug
 * Implemented prototype Altium processor to wavefront file format.
 * Unit testing setup.

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)

For this sprint, documentation was completed, including the addition of the testing and acceptance plans. Fixed the end simulation hover bug. The testing for lognormal distributions is implemented by the prior team but commented out due to the lack of a testing environment. We have implemented the Unity test runner to run test scripts.

## Unfinished Work
Generate report on statistically significant simulations for the application. Add systems testing scripts.

## Completed Issues/User Stories
* Issue https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-S25-F25/-mda-unity3dapp-/issues/23: Hover in End simulation button won't leave mouse and won't let run monte carlo.

## Code Files for Review
Please review the following code files, which were actively developed during this sprint, for quality:

 
## Retrospective Summary
What Went Well:
* Improved user interaction after analyzing the scripts and Unity editor to understand the issue.
* Significant progress was made on Altium to wavefront converter.
* Unit testing setup was completed by adding and editing an assembly file to allow tests outside the scripts folder.

What Needs Improvement:
* Creating and assigning issues as smaller tasks.

Changes to Implement in the Next Sprint:
* Complete and document unit testing.
* Research on how to proceed with systems testing.
