## Reasoning
  * [Integration of real-world measurements for whiskers, specifically utilizing microns for precise scale representation.](https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-S24-F24/-mda-unity3dapp-/issues/17)
  * [Optimized and accurate acceleration behavior of whiskers.](https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-S24-F24/-mda-unity3dapp-/issues/24)
  * We did not get to either of these issues because other issues were hindering the progression of this task.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * User experience getting polished.
  * Events are happening when needed.
  * Development of an interactive interface for simulation parameters.  
   
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * Implementation of more precise environmental force models, including gravity, to elevate simulation realism.
   * Optimization of the Monte Carlo simulation for enhanced speed and accuracy in bridging predictions.
   * Seek to refine the user interface for defining complex simulation scenarios with ease.
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * Enhance the Monte Carlo / Regular simulation for faster and more accurate predictions.
   * Improve the UI/UX for easier setup and control of simulation parameters.
