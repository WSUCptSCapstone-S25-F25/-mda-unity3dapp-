# Sprint 1 Report (1/8/2024 - 2/4/2024)

## What's New (User Facing)
 * No new relevant elements added

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
In Sprint 1, our team introduced ourselves to our client partners with a Team Inventory. We then met with our clients. One of NASA's tin whisker experts, Jay Brusse, gave us an overview of what tin whiskers are, how they cause problems, and a general overview of the goal of our project. We then set up two meetings with the previous capstone team for this project. We also created a TEAMS group to easily communicate. They gave us a run-through of the project software. They also provided what they had left of the documentation from their project. Lastly, we set up our GitHub repo with the previous team's project.

## Unfinished Work
Our group has not yet had the opportunity to discuss with our clients the plan of the completion goals for each sprint. We plan to lay out the goals in our next meeting, but at this time we are waiting to hear more.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * Familiarized our team with our clients and mentors
  * Became familiar with the previous Tin Whiskers Unity 3D App Team
  * Gained understanding of tin (and other metal) whiskers
  * Understanding of the long-term goals of the project

Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * Understanding of the short-term goals of the project
   * Planning of the work for each spring and what is expected of our team

Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * Create a detailed layout for our to-do's each sprint
