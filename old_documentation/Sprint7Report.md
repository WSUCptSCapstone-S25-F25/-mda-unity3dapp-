## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
During Sprint 7, the team worked on several significant features and improvements. Key work involved adding new UI functionalities such as the whisker spawn box toggle and the progress meter for Monte Carlo simulations. We also made progress on Monte Carlo results adding results that NASA requested. In terms of simulation accuracy, the team switched the mu and sigma positioning to improve the correctness of the models. The addition of environment lighting, coloring of colliding whiskers, and inspection mode provided better visual feedback for the users, improving the overall user experience. There was also a focus on enhancing the backend, specifically implementing the ability to load and parse multiple PCBs, as well as improving the selection of conductive components. Additionally, the STIG checks were almost fully completed, improving security compliance. The team overcame a few challenges related to UI organization and ensuring the stability of the Monte Carlo results, but these were addressed as part of the sprint.

## Unfinished Work
* **Scene UI Fixes for Organization and Workflow**: The team didnâ€™t get a chance to fully organize and optimize the scene UI for better workflow.
* **Use Built-in Features for Results Previewer UI/Scroller**: The implementation of built-in features to improve efficiency in the previewer UI was not fully completed.
* **Unit and System-Level Tests**: Although tests were started, formal unit and system-level tests were not fully implemented during the sprint.
* **GPU or Parallel Processing for Monte Carlo Simulation**: The exploration of GPU or other forms of parallel processing to speed up the Monte Carlo simulations was not completed.
* **Optimize Viable Ranges**: Further work is required to optimize the viable ranges to prevent system breakage by users.
* **Fix Application UI Scaling and Visual Appeal**: The team didn't have enough time to complete the UI scaling fixes and visual enhancements for a more user-friendly interface.
* **Shock and Vibration Results**: The feature to have shock and vibration only show in the results if enabled during simulation was not fully integrated.
* **Fix Conductive Component Toggles**: The issue with toggling conductive components when leaving and returning to the board settings page was not fully resolved.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
* The integration of new features such as the Monte Carlo progress meter and whisker spawn box toggle was smooth.
* We successfully implemented several visual improvements, including environment lighting and coloring colliding whiskers.
* Significant progress was made on the STIG checks, with nearly all completed.

Here's what we'd like to improve:
* Time management for UI-related tasks, as some improvements had to be pushed to the next sprint.
* Better planning for implementing tests, as some unit and system tests were left incomplete.

Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
* Focus on completing the unit and system-level tests.
* Continue improving the UI for better scaling and usability.
* Work on optimizing the Monte Carlo simulation through parallel processing or GPU acceleration.
* Address the incomplete features like shock and vibration integration and UI organization.
