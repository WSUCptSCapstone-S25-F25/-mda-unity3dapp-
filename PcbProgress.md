2. Configuration and Setup of Altium

After installation, I configured Altium by setting up libraries, project directories.

3. Loading an Example Project

To test the installation and configuration, I loaded an example PCB project in Altium. This helped confirm that the software was functioning correctly and provided a baseline for exporting models.
