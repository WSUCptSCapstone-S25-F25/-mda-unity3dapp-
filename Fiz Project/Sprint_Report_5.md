# Sprint 5 Report (4/2/2025 - 5/2/2025)

## What's New (User Facing)
 * Nothing new yet

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)

The completion of this sprint met difficulties because of unexpected changes made by our clients, they abandoned the project and we had to spend time acquiring a new project and client. As a result, we only started interacting with the new client around 2 weeks ago, so there wasn't much time for any technical advancement. Nevertheless, we started working on documentation to progress deliverables, added client hours report, started our project report, and initiated our initial ER diagram for the database. We also began coordination with the website team
.
