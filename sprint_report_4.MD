# Sprint 4 Report (4/2/2025 - 5/2/2025)

## What's New (User Facing)
 * Added unit test cases
 * Materials selected as conductive are save and loaded back when loading PCB again

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
For this sprint, we added some test scripts to verify the correctness of the objects SimState and WhiskerCollider. We implement saving the current state of PCB conductive components in a file and load it once the PCB is loaded again. We also work on documentation, we added alpha prototype description, alpha prototype demonstration and future work section into our project report.

## Retrospective Summary
What Went Well:
* Successfully saved and loaded the PCB state.
* Expanded unit testing

What Needs Improvement:
* Be more active in github

Changes to Implement in the Next Sprint:
* Research deeper into other options about how to automate conductive material detection
* Finish unit and system testing.
