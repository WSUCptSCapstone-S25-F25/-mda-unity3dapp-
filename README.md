# Metal Whisker Modeling

## Project summary
### One-sentence description of the project
This project involves developing a software tool that enables users to import a 3D model of a printed circuit board (PCB), detect its exposed conductors, simulate the impact of a storm of dislodged metal whiskers on the PCB, and analyze the resulting data.

## Functionality
Load 3D Models of PCBs: Import and visualize 3D models of PCBs within the Unity environment.

Identify Exposed Conductors: Detect and highlight the exposed conductive areas on the PCB.

Simulate Metal Whisker Storms: Simulate the random distribution and landing of detached metal whiskers on the PCB surface.

Analyze Results: Record and analyze data from the simulation to assess the potential impact of metal whiskers on the PCB's functionality.

The tool is intended to assist engineers and researchers in understanding and mitigating the risks associated with metal whiskers in electronic systems. It provides a user-friendly interface for running simulations and visualizing outcomes, making it a valuable resource for studying this phenomenon.

## Known Problems
Currently, the Monte Carlo simulation isn't properly adding a storm of whiskers.
