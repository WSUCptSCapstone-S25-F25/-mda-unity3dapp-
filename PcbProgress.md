2. Configuration and Setup of Altium

After installation, I configured Altium by setting up libraries, project directories.

3. Loading an Example Project

To test the installation and configuration, I loaded an example PCB project in Altium. This helped confirm that the software was functioning correctly and provided a baseline for exporting models.

4. Researching STEP File Format & Exporting Altium Project

Before exporting, I researched the STEP file format to ensure compatibility with our workflow. Successfully exporting the project as a STEP file was a critical milestone.

I converted the exported STEP file to the .obj format using an online tool. This step ensured that the model could be loaded into Unity.
